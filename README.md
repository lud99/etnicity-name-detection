# etnicity-name-detection
Predicts if any name is 'white' or 'other'. It's trained with the names of the swedish population

A project made just for fun to try and AI. You can enter any 'non-white' name such as a variation of Ahmed, like "Ahmed Abdulla Mohammed Jan-Bj√∂rklund Walla" 
and it successfully predicts that it's 'other'. Some names that are definetly swedish aren't recognised as such sadly, but as a fun project it works surprisingly well.

Credit to ```https://github.com/bolddp/swedish-names``` and Statistikmyndigheten for the names used for the training.
